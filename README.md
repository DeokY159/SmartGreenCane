### 1-1. What's a problem
Visually impaired individuals encounter various physical obstacles and unexpected situations in their daily lives. During outdoor activities, they are particularly vulnerable to risks such as collisions with obstacles or falls while using a white cane. In many cases, it is difficult for them to request immediate assistance, which can severely impact their safety and quality of life.
Additionally, tactile paving, designed to support the safe mobility of visually impaired individuals, serves as their "eyes." However, surveys reveal that many tactile pavings are damaged or improperly installed, becoming potential causes of accidents instead. In fact, 57% of surveyed locations lacked tactile paving, and over half of the installed pavings failed to meet proper standards, preventing them from fulfilling their intended purpose.
To address this issue, a systematic approach is needed to ensure the safety and independence of visually impaired individuals.

### 1-2. How We Solve the Problem
The Green Cane, provided to individual visually impaired people, is a specially designed cane for their safety. This cane detects the impact when the visually impaired person falls, emits an alert sound, and notifies the guardian in real-time, enabling quick response. Additionally, the Green Cane provides feedback to the visually impaired person about hazardous areas and helps the guardian track the real-time location of the individual. These features strengthen the safety of the visually impaired and offer an effective solution to alleviate the guardian's concerns.

### 1-3. The Positive Impact of Our Solution
By providing various data about visually impaired individuals to their guardians and public institutions, the possibility of them encountering dangerous situations can be proactively prevented. This enhances the safety system available to the visually impaired and offers greater peace of mind to their guardians. The introduction of the Green Cane creates a foundation for the visually impaired and their guardians to live in a safer and more reliable environment. This system will contribute significantly to improving the quality of life for the visually impaired.
